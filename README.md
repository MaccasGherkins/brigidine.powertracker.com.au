Powering Change @ Brigidine College
===================================

This is a base site for building a Jekyll website of a common layout.

* Bootstrap
* Bootswatch
* Home and About pages
* Sitemap and 404 pages to list pages
* Contact page with verify
* Navbar with current page `active`


## Sitemap and 404

* If you don't want a page to appear in the sitemap, add frontmatter

```yaml
sitemap: false
```

## Header Image

Fluid image beneath the Navbar. This will look for `header.jpg` in the current
directory. Or define it explicitly

```yaml
headerimage: true
headerimage: \images\filename.jpg
```
