            As the Earth rapidly heads towards intolerable climate change, Brigidine College Randwick is taking a leading role in solving this massive problem. By creating localised action that will have a ripple effect into the broader community, the college seeks to take ownership for driving the change needed to solve these problems. Beyond the obvious harvesting of our own energy through the use of solar panels, lies an abundance of opportunities. Renewing our connection with the earth and one another takes things to a whole other level.
