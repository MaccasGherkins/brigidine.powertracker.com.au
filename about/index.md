Powering Change @ BCR, is a digital display of Brigidine College's minute by minute - energy use, energy generation, water and paper usage along with other sustainability related issues. It will be presented through a large LCD screen located in a highly visible and safe location within the school. The display will be managed through a school owned website where students can assess information on a deeper level.

Brigidine College Randwick is in the process of installing PV solar panels to the roof of the Delany building. This will allow the school to generate large parts of its electricity needs through the power of renewable energy.

However looking up and seeing a solar panel generating clean energy, whilst reducing our carbon emissions and our electricity bills is one thing, but to be able to visualise minute by minute changes in the schools social dynamic and ecological footprint, is another thing altogether.

This 'visualisation' will form the centre piece of and represent the tangible results from the schools major collaborative STEM project, 'Powering Change'. This project will see a diverse range of subject areas, including Design & Technology, Science, Mathematics, HISE and Religious Education, partner with industry leaders from the broader community to design, develop and present the data in rich engaging ways.

This 'visualisation' will be presented on a large LCD screen in a high traffic area of the school that will act as the connection point for students and staff, so that they may see the schools ecological impacts and sustainability efforts.

The screen will stream our dedicated website which will be displaying the live data collected from data loggers installed around the school. The site will be managed and developed by our year 10 Graphic Technology students in partnership with GreenSense.

The project and accompanying educational resources will support a range of different learning outcomes across the college.
Once the project reaches a level of maturity and it is evaluated, we then envisioned that it would be rolled out to other schools within the region of NSW.
